    The per-file `mine_lock` only protects delete+insert interleave for a
    single source; it does not prevent N copies of `mempalace mine <dir>`
    from being spawned concurrently by hooks. When that happens, each copy
    drives ChromaDB HNSW inserts in parallel against the same palace,
    which (combined with chromadb's multi-threaded ParallelFor) can
    corrupt the HNSW graph and produce sparse link_lists.bin blowups.

    The lock file is keyed by sha256(palace_path) so mines against
    *different* palaces can still run in parallel — we only serialize
    writes into the same palace, which is the correctness boundary.

    The key is derived from a fully normalized form of the path:
    `realpath` resolves symlinks and `..` segments, and `normcase` folds
    case on Windows (which has a case-insensitive filesystem). Without
    normcase, `C:\\Palace` and `c:\\palace` would hash to different keys
    on Windows and let two concurrent mines touch the same on-disk palace.

    Non-blocking: if another `mine` is already writing to this palace,
    raise MineAlreadyRunning so the caller can exit cleanly instead of
    piling up as a waiting worker.

    Re-entrant: if the current thread already holds the lock for the same
    palace, the context manager passes through without re-acquiring. This
    lets ChromaCollection write methods (which acquire the lock themselves
    to protect MCP/direct callers) compose with miner.mine() (which holds
