# v2 (2026-04): introduced strip_noise() for Claude Code JSONL; previous

    chromadb's Rust core and Python's ``sqlite3`` both operate on the palace
    database. Issuing a statement from Python against a database the Rust side
    has already released can land on a mapping it left behind, and on some
    SQLite builds that access is a **SIGBUS** — no exception, no traceback, the
    interpreter dies mid-write.

    The root cause was ours and is fixed: ``ChromaBackend.close()`` used to
    checkpoint the WAL *after* releasing its clients. It now checkpoints first,
    while the client is still attached (see ``backends/chroma.py``). That
    removed the crash on every build measured, including the ones that used to
    die:

        python 3.12.11 + sqlite 3.50.4  -> SIGBUS before the fix
        python 3.13.14 + sqlite 3.51.0  -> clean (3,605 tests)
        python 3.13.14 + sqlite 3.53.3  -> SIGBUS before, clean after (3,608)
        python 3.14.6  + sqlite 3.53.3  -> SIGBUS before, clean after (3,607)

    This guard stays because the failure mode is uniquely bad — a signal, not
    an error — and because the ordering rule is easy to reverse in a future
    refactor without anything going red on the developer's own SQLite build.
    It is a tripwire for an untested combination, not a claim of breakage.

    Note 3.51.0 and 3.53.x differ in how a checkpoint folds the WAL: 3.51.0
    truncates the ``-wal`` to 0 bytes, 3.53.x removes the file. Both are
    "folded"; code that asserts one shape breaks on the other.

    Returns the warning text (also logged) or None when the version is known
    good. Never raises and never blocks the open — an untested version is not
    proof of breakage, and refusing to start would be worse than the risk.

    For CLI and repair commands that want consistent, actionable user-facing

    and library callers should catch
    :class:`mempalace.backends.PalaceNotFoundError` /
    :class:`mempalace.backends.CollectionNotInitializedError` directly.

    The MCP server (``mcp_server.tool_status``) deliberately does NOT use
    this helper: it uses ``_get_collection(create=db_exists)`` so a valid
    palace whose collection was never bootstrapped lazily gets one on the
    first status call, and a corruption-detection sqlite-only probe fires
    first when the vector path is disabled (see PR #831 / issue #830).

    State A: palace dir is absent.
    State B: dir is present but no backend database artifact is present.
        The helper short-circuits to a message before reaching the backend,
        because some backends lazily create their DB file on first open —
        calling the backend on this state would silently mutate the filesystem
        for what should be a read-only inspection.
    State C: DB is present but the ``mempalace_drawers`` collection has
        never been bootstrapped (``init`` ran, ``mine`` has not).
    State D: healthy — returns the opened collection.
    State E: an unexpected error opens the backend — message points the
        user at ``repair-status`` for further diagnosis.

    ``out`` is the message sink; defaults to the builtin ``print``. Pass a
    callable (e.g. a repair progress emitter) to route messages through it.

    """Best-effort garbage collection for orphaned per-source-file mine locks.

    ``_cleanup_mine_lock_file`` reclaims a lock file correctly on the happy
    path (see its docstring) — but only for the *specific* lock a
    :func:`mine_lock` context manager just released. A process that dies
    before reaching its own ``finally`` block (killed, crashed, force-quit,
    host reboot) never runs that cleanup, and nothing else in this codebase
    later revisits that lock file. Locks in ``~/.mempalace/locks/`` can
    accumulate unboundedly over time as a result — one long-lived
    installation was found with 5,636 stale entries, the oldest several
    months old, none held by any live process (confirmed via ``lsof``).

    This reuses :func:`_cleanup_mine_lock_file` itself for the actual
    removal — same nonblocking-flock-reacquire safety mechanism, same
    Windows/POSIX handling, no duplicated locking logic. A lock is only
    ever removed after *this* process re-acquires it, so anything
    genuinely held by a live process is left untouched regardless of
    ``min_age_seconds``. ``min_age_seconds`` is a courtesy throttle only —
    it avoids racing a lock that was *just* released and may still be
    mid-rendezvous with a waiter on the same pathname; it is not a
    substitute for the flock check, which is what actually makes removal
    safe.

    Skips ``mine_palace_*.lock`` files — those belong to the newer
    palace-level :func:`mine_palace_lock` and have their own
    lifecycle/holder tracking; this targets only the per-source-file locks
    :func:`mine_lock` creates via :func:`_mine_lock_path`.

    Returns ``(reaped, skipped)`` counts, for logging/testing — callers

# the process-held lease, re-acquire the flock, and self-conflict

    """Per-palace non-blocking lock around the full `mine` pipeline.

    The per-file `mine_lock` only protects delete+insert interleave for a
    single source; it does not prevent N copies of `mempalace mine <dir>`
    from being spawned concurrently by hooks. When that happens, each copy
    drives ChromaDB HNSW inserts in parallel against the same palace,
    which (combined with chromadb's multi-threaded ParallelFor) can
    corrupt the HNSW graph and produce sparse link_lists.bin blowups.

    The lock file is keyed by sha256(palace_path) so mines against
    *different* palaces can still run in parallel — we only serialize
    writes into the same palace, which is the correctness boundary.

    The key is derived from a fully normalized form of the path:
    `realpath` resolves symlinks and `..` segments, and `normcase` folds
    case on Windows (which has a case-insensitive filesystem). Without
    normcase, `C:\\Palace` and `c:\\palace` would hash to different keys
    on Windows and let two concurrent mines touch the same on-disk palace.

    Non-blocking by default: if another `mine` is already writing to this
    palace, raise MineAlreadyRunning so the caller can exit cleanly instead
    of piling up as a waiting worker.

    ``wait_seconds`` > 0 turns that into a bounded wait: the non-blocking
    acquire is retried until the deadline before the contention error is
    raised. This is for SHORT writers (a single add/update through the tool
    layer), which have nothing to gain from failing while a legitimate,
    live, minutes-long `mine` finishes — a mine pass measured at 60-90s here
    was refusing every one of them (2026-08-02). Mines themselves must keep
    the default of 0: queueing mine passes behind each other is exactly what
    this lock exists to prevent. A poll loop rather than a blocking flock so
    the deadline is honoured on every platform and the inode-currency
    protocol above still runs on each attempt.

    Re-entrant: if the current process already holds the lock for the same
    palace, the context manager passes through without re-acquiring. This
    lets ChromaCollection write methods (which acquire the lock themselves
    to protect MCP/direct callers) compose with miner.mine() (which holds
    the outer lock for the entire mine pipeline) without self-deadlock, and
    lets the threaded MCP HTTP transport write from a worker thread while the
    long-lived writer-lease is held on another thread of the same process.

    transcripts are NOT assumed immutable: a Claude Code session keeps
    appending to its own file while active, and /compact or /clear can

    prefetch_mined_set()'s stored mtimes instead of calling this function
    per file (same mtime-aware decision, without the O(n) per-file query
    cost); this function's check_mtime=True path remains its per-file,
    lock-held race-condition recheck.

    ChromaDB query per file.

    Return type is a dict rather than a bare set so callers get mtime
    awareness "for free": conversation transcripts are not immutable once
    mined (a Claude Code session keeps appending to the same file while
    active, and /compact or /clear can rewrite one in place), so "we've
    seen this source_file before" is not suffient to skip it -- the caller
    must also confirm its current on-disk mtime still matches what was
    stored. `if src in mined_set` still means the same thing as the old
    set-based return (dict `in` checks keys); a caller that wants staleness
    detection reads `mined_set[src]` and compares against
    os.path.getmtime(src) itself. `None` means either no mtime was ever
    stored (drawers written before this field existed) or getmtime failed
    when the drawer was written -- both should be treated as stale.

    When extract_mode is set, mirrors file_already_mined(..., extract_mode=...)
    so conversation mines skip per extraction mode rather than per source file.

    Completeness mirrors :func:`file_already_mined`'s ``chunk_total`` rule
    (#2183): a source that only has a mid-file partial (surviving drawers
    share the current mtime but are short of ``chunk_total``) is **omitted**
    from the result so the bulk skip path re-mines instead of permanently
    stranding the missing exchanges. Drawers with no ``chunk_total``
    (legacy rows, registry sentinels) are trusted on their own, as before.

    The convo miner walks thousands of transcript files; per-file
    `collection.get(where={"source_file": X})` costs ~2s on a 150k-drawer
    palace, making a 2000-file sweep take >1h of pure skip-checking. This
