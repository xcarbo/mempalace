"""Per-palace discovery registry for the MemPalace HTTP MCP hub.

``mempalace serve`` (and ``mempalace-mcp --transport http``) is meant to be
the single long-lived writer for a shared palace: once it performs its first
mutating tool call it holds the per-palace MCP writer lease (#1818) for its
whole lifetime, and every other process is refused palace writes. That is
correct for agents — they talk to the hub — but the background save hooks
and the plain CLI still spawn short-lived ``mempalace mine`` processes,
which would be refused while a hub is up and silently stop transcript
capture on the hub machine.

This module gives those local processes a way to find the hub instead of
fighting it: the HTTP transport records ``{pid, host, port, scheme,
read_only}`` next to the per-palace bearer token
(``~/.mempalace/server/<key>/``), and callers use
:func:`read_live_serverinfo` to decide "forward this write over HTTP" vs
"no hub — do the write directly".

The registry is local-machine only by design: it lives under the user's
home, is keyed by the canonical palace path, and a record is trusted only
while the recorded pid is still alive — a crashed hub leaves a stale file
that every reader ignores and the next hub overwrites.
