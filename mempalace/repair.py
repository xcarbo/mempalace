"""
repair.py — Scan, prune corrupt entries, and rebuild HNSW index
================================================================

When ChromaDB's HNSW index accumulates duplicate entries (from repeated
add() calls with the same ID), link_lists.bin can grow unbounded —
terabytes on large palaces — eventually causing segfaults.

This module provides four operations:

  status  — compare sqlite vs HNSW element counts (read-only health check)
  scan    — find every corrupt/unfetchable ID in the palace
  prune   — delete only the corrupt IDs (surgical)
  rebuild — extract all drawers, delete the collection, recreate with
            correct HNSW settings, and upsert everything back

The rebuild backs up ONLY chroma.sqlite3 (the source of truth), not the
full palace directory — so it works even when link_lists.bin is bloated.

Usage (standalone):
    python -m mempalace.repair status
    python -m mempalace.repair scan [--wing X]
    python -m mempalace.repair prune --confirm
    python -m mempalace.repair rebuild

Usage (from CLI):
    mempalace repair
    mempalace repair-scan [--wing X]
    mempalace repair-prune --confirm

    The repair preflight aborts when ``PRAGMA quick_check`` reports SQLite-layer
    corruption. After concurrent killed-mid-write mines (#1596) the common
    failure is an isolated ``malformed inverted index for FTS5 table``, and
    ``rebuild`` recovers it by regenerating the index from
    ``embedding_fulltext_search_content``.

    That error says the index and the content table disagree; it does not say
    which of them is wrong. So the content table is checked against
    ``embedding_metadata`` first, and any row that disagrees is restored from it
    before the rebuild reads it — otherwise a rebuild over a damaged content
    table would overwrite an index that still held the drawer's own words and
    leave quick_check clean, reporting success for a palace that lost full-text
    reach. Both writes are derived from ``embedding_metadata``; rows that
    table cannot speak for are left untouched.

    Everything happens under the palace write lock (so a live mine cannot race
    it) and in one transaction, which is why a restored row cannot outlive a
    rebuild that then fails. Returns the remaining quick_check errors — empty
    when the heal succeeded. Broader corruption, a lock held by another writer,
    a content table that cannot be checked or cannot be brought into agreement,
    a rebuild failure, or a quick_check still dirty afterwards leaves ``errors``
    unchanged so the caller still aborts with the banner.

    Bypasses the chromadb client entirely — never opens a
    ``PersistentClient``, never imports hnswlib, never invokes the
    HNSW segment writer. This is the recovery path for palaces where
    ``Collection.count()`` / ``Collection.get()`` raise ``InternalError``
    because the compactor cannot apply WAL logs to the HNSW segment
    (#1308). The drawer rows are still on disk in
    ``embeddings`` + ``embedding_metadata``; the corruption lives in the
    on-disk index files, not the SQLite tables.

    Resolution rule for chromadb's typed metadata columns: each
    ``embedding_metadata`` row stores its value in exactly one of
    ``string_value`` / ``int_value`` / ``float_value`` / ``bool_value``;
    we pick the first non-NULL column in that order. Rows where every
    typed column is NULL are dropped (chromadb never writes that shape).
    The ``chroma:document`` key is removed from the metadata dict and
    returned as the document; this matches how chromadb itself stores
    ``add(documents=...)``.

    Driven from ``embeddings`` (LEFT JOIN ``embedding_metadata``), not
    the other way around: an embedding with zero ``embedding_metadata``
    rows — a sparse historical write with no ``chroma:document`` and no
    other key, the same condition ``_extract_drawers`` already sanitizes

    """Rebuild a palace by reading drawers from ``source_palace``'s
    ``chroma.sqlite3`` and upserting them into a fresh palace at
    ``dest_palace``.

    Recovery path for the #1308 failure mode: the chromadb client raises
    ``InternalError: Failed to apply logs to the hnsw segment writer``
    on every operation that touches the index (``count``, ``get``,
    ``query``), but the underlying SQLite tables are intact. Both the
    legacy ``rebuild_index`` and the inline ``cli.cmd_repair`` path call
    ``Collection.count()`` as their first read — exactly the call that
    fails — so neither can recover this class of corruption. This
    function bypasses the chromadb read path entirely via
    :func:`extract_via_sqlite`.

    Re-embeds documents at upsert time using the configured embedding
    function; the original HNSW vectors are not preserved (they live in
    the corrupt ``data_level0.bin`` / ``link_lists.bin``, not in
    SQLite). Acceptable for a corruption-recovery flow because the
    embedding model is deterministic — same model + same document text
    yields semantically equivalent search results.

    ``archive_existing_dest`` controls behavior when ``dest_palace``
    already exists:

    * ``False`` (default) — refuse with a clear message. Callers must
      manually move the existing palace aside first.
    * ``True`` — rename ``dest_palace`` to
      ``<dest_palace>.pre-rebuild-<timestamp>`` and read from there
      instead. Used by the in-place CLI flow where ``--source`` defaults
      to the same path as ``--palace``.

    ``dry_run`` (CLI: ``--dry-run``) previews the rebuild without making any
    change: source validation runs as normal, then per-collection row counts
    are read from the source SQLite and printed, and the function returns
    those would-be counts *without* archiving the existing palace, taking the
    mine-lock, creating collections, or re-embedding (#2095, #2133). Useful
    before a multi-hour rebuild on a large palace. A dry run returns a
    populated dict (one key per recoverable collection) so CLI callers treat
    it as success; a validation refusal still returns ``{}`` exactly as a real
    run would. If SQLite row counts cannot be read, the preview fails closed
    with ``{}`` rather than inventing zeros.

    Returns a ``{collection_name: row_count}`` dict so callers (CLI,
    tests) can verify the per-collection rebuild count without parsing
    stdout. A successful rebuild always returns a dict with one key per
    recoverable collection (values may be ``0`` when a collection is
    legitimately empty in the source). The empty dict ``{}`` is reserved
    for validation refusals (missing source DB, refusing to overwrite an
    existing dest, in-place mode without ``archive_existing_dest``); CLI
    callers should treat ``{}`` as an error and exit non-zero so CI and
    scripts can distinguish "invalid inputs" from "successful recovery
    that found zero rows." Raises :class:`RebuildPartialError` if a
    chromadb upsert fails partway through; the dest palace is left in
    place so the user can inspect what landed, and the in-place archive
    (when applicable) is reported in the error so the user can re-run
    against it. Raises :class:`RebuildCleanupError` if all rows land but the
    required FTS5 rebuild, VACUUM, or final quick_check fails; this prevents a
    structurally unverified recovery from being reported as complete.

    .. warning::

       In-place mode (``source_palace == dest_palace`` with
       ``archive_existing_dest=True``) calls
       ``chromadb.api.client.SharedSystemClient.clear_system_cache()`` to
       drop chromadb's process-wide System registry — required because
       an existing cached System built against the original palace will
       refuse ``create_collection`` after the dir is renamed (chromadb
       still thinks the collections exist). This invalidates any
       PersistentClient instances held elsewhere in the same process for
       *any* palace, not just this one. Do not call this function from
       inside a long-running mempalace process (MCP server, daemon)
       while other callers hold live ``PersistentClient`` references —
       use the CLI in a separate process instead. Cross-palace use
       (``source != dest``) does not touch the cache.

    Note on metadata fidelity: the resolution rule
    (``string_value`` → ``int_value`` → ``float_value`` → ``bool_value``)
    matches the precedent in :mod:`mempalace.migrate`. ChromaDB 0.4.x
    occasionally wrote booleans as ``int_value=0/1``; those will
    round-trip as ``int`` rather than ``bool`` after this rebuild. This
    is a known divergence and matches the existing migrate-path
    behavior.
