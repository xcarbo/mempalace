sweeper.py — Message-granular miner that catches what the file-level
primary miners dropped.

Algorithm, per session:

    cursor = max(timestamp of sweeper-written drawers for this session_id)
    For each user/assistant message in the jsonl:
        if cursor is not None and message.timestamp < cursor: skip
        else: upsert a drawer keyed by (session_id, message_uuid)

Properties:

  - Idempotent on its own writes: rerunning is a no-op because drawer
    IDs are deterministic and existence is pre-checked before counting.
  - Resume-safe: a crash mid-sweep is recovered on the next run — the
    cursor advances to the last ingested timestamp and re-attempts at
    that boundary are de-duped by the deterministic ID.
  - Tie-break safe: uses ``< cursor`` (not ``<=``), so if multiple
    messages share the max timestamp and only some were ingested, the
    rest are still picked up on re-run.
  - No size caps: each drawer holds one exchange, ~1-5 KB.

Coordination with the primary file-level miners (``miner.py`` /
``convo_miner.py``) is limited: those miners chunk at a fixed char size
and do not currently stamp ``session_id``/``timestamp`` metadata that
the sweeper can key off. In practice the sweeper coordinates with its
own prior runs, and may ingest content that also got chunked into
primary-miner drawers (under different IDs). Follow-up: add uniform
``ingest_mode`` + message metadata to the primary miners so dedup spans
both paths.
