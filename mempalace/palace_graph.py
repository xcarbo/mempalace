palace_graph.py — Graph traversal layer for MemPalace
======================================================

Builds a navigable graph from the palace structure:
  - Nodes = rooms (named ideas)
  - Edges = shared rooms across wings (tunnels)
  - Edge types = halls (the corridors)

Enables queries like:
  "Start at chromadb-setup in wing_code, walk to wing_myproject"
  "Find all rooms connected to riley-college-apps"
  "What topics bridge wing_hardware and wing_myproject?"

No external graph DB needed — built from ChromaDB metadata.

# TOPIC TUNNELS — auto-link wings that share confirmed TOPIC labels
# =============================================================================
# When two wings have one or more confirmed topics in common (e.g. both
# discuss "Angular" or "OpenAPI"), drop a symmetric tunnel between them.
# Topics come from the LLM-refined ``TOPIC`` bucket in the per-project
# ``entities.json`` and are persisted by wing in
# ``~/.mempalace/known_entities.json`` under ``topics_by_wing``.
#
# Tunnels are created via the existing ``create_tunnel`` API so they share
# storage and dedup with explicit tunnels. The room is a synthetic
# ``topic:<original-casing>`` identifier — the ``topic:`` prefix namespaces
# these tunnels away from literal folder-derived rooms so a wing with an
# auto-detected "Angular" folder room and a "shared topic: Angular" tunnel
# remain distinct at ``follow_tunnels`` / ``list_tunnels`` time. The prefix
# is also visible to any LLM scanning the tunnel list. The ``kind: "topic"``
# field on the stored dict gives callers a machine-readable discriminator.
