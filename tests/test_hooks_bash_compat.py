"""Regression tests for the bash 3.2 compatibility fix (#1440).

The legacy hooks/*.sh scripts run on the user's system. On stock macOS
that is GNU bash 3.2.57 (Apple GPLv3 freeze, 2006). Using bash 4.0-only
builtins like ``mapfile`` silently breaks parsing: every JSON field
falls back to its default, the hook logs ``Session unknown: 0 exchanges``,
and zero drawers are saved.

These tests cover:
1. Source-level shape (mapfile/readarray absent, sed-based extraction).
2. Behavioral parse contract (session_id reaches the log, not 'unknown').
3. The fail-loud guard: fires only when the parser sentinel is missing,
   never on a legitimately empty/unicode/literal-'unknown' session_id.
4. The guard's disk discipline (bounded dump, overwrite-not-append, 0600).
