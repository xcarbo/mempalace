def test_file_already_mined_handles_multiple_groups_under_one_source_file(tmp_path):
    """Under the additive-mining model, a single ``source_file`` can have
    multiple ``parent_drawer_id`` groups in the palace — one per mining pass
    — each with its own stored ``source_mtime``. ``file_already_mined`` must
    return True if ANY group's stored mtime matches the file's current
    mtime, regardless of which group ChromaDB's ``get(..., limit=1)`` happens
    to return first.

    Current code uses ``collection.get(where={"source_file": X}, limit=1)``
    which has undefined ordering across multiple matching rows. When ChromaDB
    returns a stale group (older mining pass with a different stored mtime),
    the function returns False, the additive miner concludes the file changed,
    and writes yet another duplicate group for a file that has not actually
    changed. Steady state: duplicate groups accumulate without bound.

    This test pins the failure space deterministically using a MockCollection
    that always returns the stale group on limit=1 (worst-case ordering). A
    correct implementation iterates all groups via the paginated pattern
    already used in the ``extract_mode is not None`` branch.
