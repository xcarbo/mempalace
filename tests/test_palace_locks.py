"""Tests for mine_palace_lock — the per-palace non-blocking mine guard.

Covers the fix for the runaway mine fan-out described alongside issues
#974 and #965: if N copies of `mempalace mine` are spawned concurrently
against the same palace, they must collapse to a single runner rather
than queue as waiters that will drive parallel HNSW inserts. Mines
against *different* palaces must still be free to run in parallel.
