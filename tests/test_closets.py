"""
test_closets.py — Tests for the closet (searchable index) layer and the
features that ride on top of it: mine_lock serialization, entity metadata,
hybrid BM25+vector search, and diary ingest.

Coverage map:
  * mine_lock — acquire/release, blocks concurrent acquisition.
  * build_closet_lines — pointer-line shape, header pickup, entity stoplist
    (regression for "When/After/The"), real-name survival, fallback line.
  * upsert_closet_lines — pure overwrite (regression for the append bug),
    char-limit packing without splitting a line.
  * purge_file_closets — scoped to source_file.
  * Project-miner end-to-end rebuild — re-mining with fewer topics fully
    purges leftover numbered closets from a larger prior run.
  * _extract_drawer_ids_from_closet — pointer parsing + dedup.
  * search_memories hybrid path — drawer query always the floor,
    closets boost matching source_file, matched_via reflects both signals,
    no whole-file glue, max_distance enforcement.
  * Entity metadata — extracted, stoplist applied, registry cached by mtime.
  * Real BM25 — real IDF over candidate corpus, hybrid rerank.
  * Diary ingest — drawers + closets created, incremental skips, state
    file lives outside the diary dir, wing-prefixed drawer IDs prevent
    cross-diary collisions, force=True purges leftover closets.
